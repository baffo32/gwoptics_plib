Version 0.5.0 (31.08.2013)

o Support for Processing 2.0 added, many examples also work
  on Android but don't support this yet
o ScatterTrace added for plotting normal x/y scatter plots 
o When using Blank2DTrace you can no long plot directly to the
	PGraphics object in the graph space. You now have to convert between
	graph and screen space manually. TraceDraw(PGraphics) is now
	TraceDraw(Blank2DTrace.PlotRenderer). This contains the public
	member canvas which is the PGraphics object of the graph which can
	be drawn to manually using the usual processing functions. To
	convert from graph space to screen space you must use the
	PlotRenderer.valToX(value) and PlotRenderer.valToY(value) functions
	which convert the graph point to pixels for drawing. Although this
	adds an unnecessary layer of abstraction - as before hand you could
	draw directly in graph space - the graphic changes in Processing 2.0
	means that strokes and their weightings give ugly results and can't
	be corrected easily.

Version 0.4.4

o fixed bugs:
  - assertion error on using GaussMode 

Version 0.4.3 (17.03.2010)
